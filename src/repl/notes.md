Code to handle the inputs through the repl

## How does it work
1. The repl is created and users can enter input

   1. Statements
   2. Operations
3. Statements are defining the values to a variable which creates a statement

         1. !p1 / Â¬p1
      3. Performing operations on 2 statements
      4. p1 ^ p2
